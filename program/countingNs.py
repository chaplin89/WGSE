"""
Standalone script to process a reference model FASTA to determine the inclusion of N's in the base pair sequence.
Reads the compressed FASTA. Takes as a parameter the FASTA file. Also expects and reads in the DICT file determined
from the FASTA file name -- easier to do one pass if we have the sequence lengths.  Processes all sequences.
Detailed N segment stats writtem to RefModel.nbin.csv. Key stats per sequence and totals written to RefModel.ncnt.csv .
Also creates nat log bucket counts of number of N's; 1000 buckets per sequence. Per David Vance's display criteria.

Sequences in a reference model are arbitrarily broken up into short lines of 50-80 characters (base-pairs) each. All
white space is in-material and to be ignored.  We want to not just count how many N values in a sequence but also
(1) how many regions of contigious N's (with their mean and std dev of size) and
(2) a thousand buckets for each sequence representing the round(natlog(# of N's)) in that bucket.
Runs of contigous N values can overlap the short line and bucket boundaries and must be handled appropriately.
Due to rounding errors, the last bucket may not be the same size of base-pairs as the rest of the buckets.

Detects if a FASTQ instead of FASTA and reports error. Skips any sequence where the name is not found in the
DICT file read in to start.  Key is not just the SN but also LN fields in the DICT file.
